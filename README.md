# Neural-Network-MNIST

A basic Introduction to learning deep learning, by building my Fist ANN model.

The model is trained and tested on MNIST dataset, a dataset of handwritten digits. The models is used for classification, where it receives as input 784 features (gray scale of pixels values), and returns the predict digit in the range of  [0-9].

ANN used is a simple Neural Network, that was build using PyTorch.
